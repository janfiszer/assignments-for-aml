## Assignments for AML
A repository to store assignments for the advanced machine learning course at university of Milano-Biccoca.
1. [checkboard-problem.ipynb](https://github.com/janfiszer/assignments-for-aml/blob/main/checkboard-problem.ipynb)
Non linear separable dataset, demands multi-layer NN
2. [double-mnist.ipynb](https://github.com/janfiszer/assignments-for-aml/blob/main/double-mnist.ipynb)
Investigating size of layers as the number of features and using trained autoencoder to generate new images.
3. [transfer-learning-on-mnist.ipynb](https://github.com/janfiszer/assignments-for-aml/blob/main/transfer-learning-on-mnist.ipynb)
VGG-16 transfer learning, MNIST too easy dataset for such a strong CNN.
4. [double-mnist.ipynb](https://github.com/janfiszer/assignments-for-aml/blob/main/double-mnist.ipynb)
Monkey species classification also with transfer learning. The dataset available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/slothkong/10-monkey-species)
